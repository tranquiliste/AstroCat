# AstroCat

AstroCat is a desktop app for organizing and browsing deep-sky catalog images (Messier, NGC, Caldwell, Solar system, and more). It gives you a fast image grid, filters, rich object metadata, and notes so you can track progress and plan what to capture next.

Website: https://astro-catalogue-viewer.com/

Status: beta

## Highlights
- Fast grid with zoom, search, and filters (catalog, object type, status)
- Two-column detail view with zoom/pan, notes, and external info links
- Archive action to move selected images into an archive folder
- Wikipedia thumbnails for missing images (toggleable, cached)
- Wikipedia previews labeled as not captured
- Full-screen lightbox on double-click (Exit/Esc/Return)
- Catalog-aware image matching by filename (e.g., M31, NGC7000, C14)
- Messier ↔ NGC alias matching (M31/NGC224) so images appear in both catalogs
- Master image folder support (if all images live in one place)
- Optional catalog-specific image folders
- Offline-safe location picker (browser-based map)

## New in 3.0 (since 1.7.x)
- NGC/Caldwell metadata refresh with richer descriptions, distances, RA/Dec, and discoverer info
- Curated Wikipedia thumbnails in the NGC data plus smarter filtering to avoid map/diagram images
- Improved TIFF/high-bit image handling (tone mapping, imagecodecs support, Pillow fallback)
- Metadata updates now merge into user metadata to preserve notes; About shows both app + data versions
- Default catalog list is Messier, NGC, Caldwell, and Solar system (IC removed from the default list)

## Previously in 1.7.x
- Solar system catalog with wiki thumbnails
- Duplicate scan for exact matches (SHA-256) with report link and optional archive move
- Master image auto-sorting into catalog folders during duplicate scans
- Clear thumbnail cache tool
- Right-click image menu to open containing folder or copy path

## Quick start (dev)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app/main.py
```

## Requirements
- macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Python 3.13+ (or any Python 3.10+ that supports PySide6)
- PySide6 (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Roadmap
See `ROADMAP.md`.

## macOS Build
Clone this repo on macOS and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./scripts/build_macos.sh
```

The packaged app will be in `dist/`. GitHub releases include separate macOS builds:
- Apple Silicon: `AstroCat-macOS-AppleSilicon.zip`
- Intel: `AstroCat-macOS-Intel.zip`

## Windows Build
Clone this repo on Windows and run one of the build scripts (requires Python 3.10+):

PowerShell:
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\scripts\build_windows.ps1
```

CMD:
```bat
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\scripts\build_windows.bat
```

The packaged app will be in `dist/`.

## Linux Build
Clone this repo on Linux and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./scripts/build_linux.sh
```

The packaged app will be in `dist/`.

## Configuration
Open **Settings** to set:
- **Master Image Folder** (optional): a single folder containing all your images
- **Per-catalog Image Folder**: use if you store catalogs separately
- **Archive Image Folder**: where archived images are moved
- **Observer Location**: used for best-visibility suggestions

The “best visibility” months are computed from RA/Dec + your latitude/longitude using a sidereal-time approximation. It’s a solid planning heuristic (altitude at midnight on the 15th of each month) and will drive the “Suggested” filter accurately.

The **Wiki thumbnails** toggle lives in the main toolbar. When enabled, missing images use cached Wikipedia thumbnails and are labeled as not captured.

### Image Naming
Filenames must include the standard object ID, for example:
- `M31_Andromeda_Galaxy.jpg`
- `NGC7000 North America Nebula.tif`
- `IC5070_Pelican.png`
- `C14 Double Cluster.jpg`

The app matches IDs anywhere in the filename.

## Metadata
Metadata is stored in JSON files under `data/`. Example files included:
- `data/object_metadata.json` (Messier)
- `data/ngc_metadata.json` (sample)
- `data/ic_metadata.json` (sample)
- `data/caldwell_metadata.json` (sample)

Notes you add in the app are saved back into the catalog JSON under the `notes` field.

Messier metadata is complete and includes expanded descriptions with astrophotography guidance. The NGC, IC, and Caldwell metadata sets are in progress.

### Resetting saved settings
If the app has a bad image path or filter state saved, delete the config file:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/AstroCat/config.json`
